# Telescope Plugin for AS

Telescope is an Android Studio plugin designed to make finding drawables across all your modules a breeze.

## Features

Telescope offers two powerful search modes:

- **Fuzzy Search:** A classic approach for quick and straightforward lookups.
- **AI-Powered Search:** Advanced search capabilities using OpenCLIP models converted to the efficient GGUF format.

### Fuzzy Search

No surprises hereâ€”fuzzy search works just as you'd expect. It performs global scans across all modules, including nested
ones, to locate your drawables based on partial matches or misspellings.

### AI-Powered Search with OpenCLIP (The Fun Stuff ðŸŽ‰)

AI search takes your drawable hunting to the next level by understanding context and intent. For instance, imagine
youâ€™re looking for a drawable of a pencil icon named `ic_pencil.xml`. Fuzzy search might not help if you search for
terms
like **edit** or **update**, but AI search will intelligently connect the dots and provide accurate matches.

#### Why OpenCLIP and GGUF?

Telescope leverages OpenCLIP-compatible models in GGUF format to balance performance and memory efficiency. By using
separate models for text and vision encoders, the plugin avoids loading unnecessarily large models into memory. These
encoders are used on demand, ensuring smooth operation without compromising capabilities.
